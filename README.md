## Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with feature-based organization:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                     # Shared infrastructure
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/                 # Core data components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain/               # Core business logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/         # Shared UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ navigation/           # App routing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/             # Shared services
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/                # Utilities
â””â”€â”€ features/                 # Feature modules
    â”œâ”€â”€ auth/                 # Authentication
    â”œâ”€â”€ chat/                 # AI Chat with streaming
    â”œâ”€â”€ home/                 # Home/Movies listing
    â”œâ”€â”€ movies/               # Movies (details, search, favorites)
    â”œâ”€â”€ profile/              # User profile
    â””â”€â”€ splash/               # Splash screen
```

Each feature follows a three-layer architecture:
- **Data Layer**: API clients, models, repository implementations
- **Domain Layer**: Entities, repository interfaces, use cases
- **Presentation Layer**: Pages, widgets, BLoC/Cubit viewmodels

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.x or higher
- Dart 3.8.1 or higher
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Joselay/lumo-app.git
cd lumo-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with required configuration.

4. Generate code:
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

5. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Development

### Building and Running

```bash
flutter run                  # Run in development mode
flutter build apk            # Build APK for Android
flutter build ios            # Build for iOS
```

### Code Quality

```bash
flutter analyze              # Run static analysis
dart format .                # Format code
flutter test                 # Run tests
```

### Code Generation

After modifying models or API endpoints, run:

```bash
dart run build_runner build                              # Generate code
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs # Clean rebuild
dart run build_runner watch                              # Auto-generate on changes
```

### App Icons

```bash
flutter packages pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

## Backend

This app connects to a Django REST Framework backend with endpoints for:
- Authentication (JWT)
- Movies (TMDB integration)
- AI Chat (SSE streaming)
- User management

Backend repository: `/Users/smaetongmenglay/Documents/development/lumo/lumo-backend`

## Project Conventions

- **State Management**: BLoC pattern with immutable states using freezed
- **Events**: Past tense naming (e.g., `LoginButtonPressed`)
- **States**: Nouns with status enums (e.g., `ChatState`)
- **Code Style**: Follows flutter_lints rules
- **Immutability**: All state classes are @immutable and extend Equatable
- **Widgets**: Prefer StatelessWidget, use const constructors

## Contributing

1. Follow the three-layer architecture for new features
2. Use BLoC/Cubit for state management
3. Run `dart run build_runner build` after modifying models/APIs
4. Run `flutter analyze` and `dart format .` before committing
5. Write tests for new features
